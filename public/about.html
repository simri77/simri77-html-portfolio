<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I’m Simret Mesfin, an enthusiastic beginner web developer on an exciting journey to learn, grow, and create.
  I’ve recently discovered my passion for coding and am diving headfirst into the world of web development, eager
  to build my skills and bring ideas to life.  </p>

<p>So far, I’ve been exploring the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I’m starting to get comfortable with creating 
  simple, responsive websites. I’m also dipping my toes into frameworks like Bootstrap and libraries like React to expand 
  my toolkit. Every day, I’m learning something new, whether it’s debugging code, improving my design skills, or 
  understanding how to make websites more interactive and user-friendly.  </p>

<p>I’m a firm believer in the power of practice and persistence, and I’m constantly working on small projects to apply what 
  I’ve learned. I’m also grateful for the supportive developer community and the wealth of online resources that help me 
  grow as a coder.  </p>

<p>When I’m not coding, you’ll find me brainstorming new project ideas, reading about the latest tech trends, or enjoying 
  a good cup of coffee while troubleshooting my latest code challenge.  </p>

<p>I’m excited to take on new opportunities, collaborate with others, and continue my journey in web development. If you’d 
  like to connect, share advice, or work together on a project, I’d love to hear from you!  </p>
